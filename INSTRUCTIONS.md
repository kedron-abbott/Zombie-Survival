# Zombie-Survival
Hello! This is where you will be able to find the instructions of how to play the game.

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a continuous work in progress. I will be adding onto this to make it a full fledged game, well past the due date of the final - hopefully one that you can just play and won't have to go into the terminal to start. I do hope that you check in on this link from time to time to see if it's improved any. Thanks for the support! 

Also, when I feel the game is complete, I will post it here to let you all know. I have a lot of really cool ideas for this game that I can't wait to see come to life. 

INSTRUCTIONS: 

**Getting the Game Started** 
1. Open the folder titled "ZombieSurvivalFinal" 
2. Open the file titled "ZombieSurvivalGame.py" 
3. Click the "Raw" tab
4. Copy everything on that page [Mac Users: "⌘ + a" then "⌘ + c"] [Windows Users: "CTRL + a" then "CTRL + c"] 
5. Now open this link: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python_online.php 
6. You should see this: 

"# Hello World program in Python
    
print "Hello World!\n" 

7. Replace all of that ^ with what you copied from the "Raw" tab. 
8. Click "Execute" in top left of the page 
9. Expand the window with the button on the far right in the middle of the page. 
10. Enjoy the game! 

**How to Play** 
1. You will be given options that are indicated by two pipes that look like this "Option 1 || Option 2"
2. When you see "Response: " on the screen below the options, you may type in the option you want to go with, and the option you selected will determine. 

*If you type in a response that is not an option, you will be prompted with this "Invalid Response. Please try again.." * 
*Unless there is a secret option available...*

3. There will be some responses that are time sensitive (that time is dependant on the difficulty you chose at the beginning of the game through the "Mode" option on the start screen)
